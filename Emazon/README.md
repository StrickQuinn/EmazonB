<!-- What was the most useful tool that your group relied on the most? -->
 The most useful tool that our goup encorporated was Visual Studio Codes Live Share feature. It allowed us to write code together which meant we were able to make decisions in the moment and solve issues faster.
<!-- Explain a key feature you worked on. -->
Key features worked on:
 1. Working with react-router-dom to load components individual on the page. 
 2. ProductGrid.js functionality
 3. Adding Css using react-bootstrap
 4. Application mockup
<!-- Explain a technical challenge you came across. Was it solved? How? -->
Technical Challenges
1. We were not able to get our update route to change the product information in the database .
2. CSS in React required unfamiliar tools and concepts, but were able to produce some remarkable results such as the scrolling hero section of the app and styling the apps main form.
<!-- Explain what improvements you would make for version 2.0. -->
Version 2.0 Improvements
1. Have it so that the user can update the products in the inventory.
2. Add authentication.
3. Include an API to find information for items in the inventory.
4. Have is so that users can search to find an item, add it to the cart and check out.
